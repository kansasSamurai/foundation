# Foundation
A micro framework for creating Java Swing applications.

## branches
v00_00_01 is a branch off master : this is a snapshot of the working project before I started pruning out the LAF dependencies and creating a more structured project
v00_00_02 is a branch off master at the same time : it will be where I work on the "core" framework and I will merge it back into master when it's ready
