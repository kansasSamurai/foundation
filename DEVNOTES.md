20190702 - branch origin/master can be used going forward;
this is a reminder of why... I started with three applications
where I had copied the API from app to app and could not remember
the development history:  mmdealv2, jclock, and editor
So, I started this repo with the contents of mmdealv2.
I then created branches for the jclock and editor versions.
When realizing how similar they all were, I chose to abandon
the jclock branch and merged the editor branch back to master.
